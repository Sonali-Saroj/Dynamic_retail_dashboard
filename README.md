2. Create calculated columns for:  
   - `Profit Margin = Profit / Sales`  
   - `Total Orders = Count of Order ID`  
3. Use Excel formulas to calculate:  
   - `Total Sales = SUM(Sales)`  
   - `Total Profit = SUM(Profit)`  
   - `Total Quantity = SUM(Quantity)`  
4. Build a dynamic KPI table and use symbols to enhance visual appeal.
